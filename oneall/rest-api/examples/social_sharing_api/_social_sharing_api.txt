 With our social sharing API you can easily share content to multiple social networks simultaneously.
After having shared content, you can measure the resulting referral traffic and take snapshots of the shared
content by using the Sharing Analytics API.

Snapshots give you a summary on how many users have clicked/liked the shared content. By taking snapshots at
regular intervals you can measure the impact of the shared content and improve future shares.
