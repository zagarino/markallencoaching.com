The Connection API is mainly used in the callback handler. The callback
handler is a script that request the social network profile of a user that has
logged in to your website through on of our services, like for example Social
Login.

The callback handler script requests the social network profile of a user by
sending a <connection_token> to the Connection API. The connection API returns
the social network profile of the user and you can then use this information
to create a new account or tie the social network profile to an existing user.
