						1992 Ironman | Humpty Dumbty
					</h3>
					<p>
						&ldquo;One day in late March I headed out for a long ride. I couldn’t find anyone to come
						with me. I wasn’t happy about that at all. I liked the company of my training partners on
						long rides. It helped with the motivation. The ride was flat and I was hoping to do it fast
						just to get it over sooner. Ten miles into it I went through an intersection. My mind was
						wandering. A truck accelerated and turned right into me, hitting me and throwing my body into
						the air. I came down hard on the pavement and crumpled to the ground. &rdquo;

						It was the last day of winter, the season of darkness. I was resisting going on that ride. I
						didn’t want to be out there. I was riding out of habit because I felt like I needed to. There
						was no real motivation. Every year before I started my season I tried to come up with the
						reasons why. Why put in all those miles and suffer through the pain? Trying to win races
						wasn’t enough. And doing something out of habit would never take me to world-class. I lacked
						a fundamental vision of why I was going to train all year and race Hawaii again.

								I popped up off the ground hoping nothing was wrong. But I could hear bones in my clavicle
								crunching together. My collarbone was broken, and so was my spirit. March and April were
								when I needed to lay the big early season blocks of training that October would require.
								Without it, I had little hope of winning. And with a broken bone sidelining me for the next
								six weeks, that dream seemed impossible.
							</p>
							<p>
								I collapsed back down on the road. It was like a shocking nightmare. People had stopped to
								help and were asking me if I was okay, but their voices were dreamy and distance. I knew
								I’d been hit. I knew I had a broken collarbone. I knew where I was. But it was like I was
								in another world. I felt like every reason

							I’d raced for the past ten years had been knocked out of my body and no longer had
							relevance. Every motivation I’d had that lit that fire inside me was gone. I was like a
							speedboat clipping along and then suddenly the motor cuts out and there’s no fixing it. I
							felt like that boat drifting further and further out to sea with no way to get back to solid
							ground.
						</p>
						<p>
							I was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. Someone wheeled me into the emergency room and
							parked me next to a wall in the entryway. This was in the days before cell phones. I was
							really, really alone. None of my family or friends knew what had just happened or where I
							was. I’d been gone less than an hour so there was no reason any of them would be concerned
							yet. I laid there, no one talking to me, for over two hours. I saw a lot just lying in the
							entryway to an emergency room for two hours! Everyone that came in for medical help had the
							same look. They all just needed human contact. They needed someone to talk to them, pay
							attention to them, to acknowledge that they even existed. I wondered if I had that same
							look!
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally, the dulling effect of being in shock wore off. The pain was settling in. Two-hours
							and not even a “hi” or a “how are you” from anyone. I stopped one of the doctors and asked
							when someone was going to see me. She looked stunned. “We all thought you were waiting to be
							picked up!” She got me looked at right away! Later that night I was still trying to make
							sense of the day. I was kicking myself for not listening to the resistance I was having to
							doing the ride and just skipping it. My collarbone was broken. My arm was in a sling. I
							could feel my whole body getting stiffer by the minute. I stood up from the couch in my
							living room to walk down the hallway that led to the bathroom. I was wallowing in the whole
							situation.
						</p>
						<p>
							The next thing I knew I was completely confused again. I couldn’t make sense of anything. My
							eyes were closed but I didn’t have a clue why. I was hearing voices getting more distant by
							the second like I was traveling back through a tube away from them. I finally got my eyes to
							open. All I could see was something white close to my face. It took a few seconds to
							register that I was looking up at the underside of the toilet. There was something really
							wet on my face, but I couldn’t figure out what it was or how it got there. It took a minute
							to rearrange my body on the floor so I could get my good arm free and put my fingers to my
							face. I was bleeding. I had passed out and split my head open on the toilet on my crash to
							the floor. Blood was pouring down my face. It was too much. I was broken. For the second
							time in the same day I felt like I wasn’t connected to my life. I didn’t feel connected to
							anything. It was like I was floating between two worlds. There was no thread from my past
							that was connecting me to my future. Yesterday’s motivations held no importance. No reason
							was grounding me to continue on to tomorrow.
						</p>
						<p>
							I had three Ironman victories. Winning those had been a focus for the bulk of my adult life.
							All that had no meaning as I lay bleeding on the floor. The only thing I knew for sure was
							that I was going to have to make my second trip to the emergency room on the same day. Then
							something deep and distant began to get clear. It was the reason to go on. It had nothing to
							do with trying to win again. It was more personal and much broader than the sport. I’d
							experienced the thrill of winning. But the greatest value in my Ironman journey had been how
							it had helped me grow as a person. The Ironman is an extreme challenge that exposed my
							weaknesses and begged me to find strengths I never knew I had. Even the disaster years were
							gifts from the Island. The tough races taught me about myself and about life. They taught me
							how to manage intense challenge and how to keep calm under extreme pressure. They showed me
							how to keep going even when achieving my ultimate dream looked impossible and how to find
							worth in giving that “less than perfect” effort. They taught me how to give everything I had
							even if on that day “everything” was less than I might have on another one.

							Those were lessons that made life worthwhile. And there were still more I needed to learn
							through that amazing race in that amazing place. A new lesson was waiting for me in Kona, if
							I could pick up the pieces and go there to “learn” rather than to “achieve”.
						</p>
						<p>
							I had to get healthy! In 1990 I’d met Brant Secunda who is a shaman, healer and ceremonial
							leader in the Huichol Indian tradition that comes from Mexico. He’s the adopted grandson of
							Don José, the great Huichol shaman whose vision carried me to victory in 1989. I’d been
							studying with Brant and learning about the Huichol tradition for almost three years. It was
							helping to broaden my understanding of life, which was the essence of what Ironman and the
							Island of Hawaii was also helping me to do. Brant did two very powerful healings on my
							collarbone just a couple of days after my accident. Within two weeks I was back training,

							four weeks less than the western doctors said I needed. Six weeks after the accident, the
							point where I should have just started back into training, I was right where I needed to be
							with my fitness to have a real chance in Kona.
						</p>
							By October I felt ready. But there was one thing that kept me on edge. It was the thought of
							having to run next to someone who was a better runner than I was. I went through the list of
							guys I knew were racing. I couldn’t come up with one person I felt was a stronger runner
							than I was…that is until the press conference two days before the race.

							By October I felt ready. But there was one thing that kept me on edge. It was the thought of

							guys I knew were racing. I couldn’t come up with one person I felt was a stronger runner
							than I was…that is until the press conference two days before the race.
						</p>
						<p>
							An athlete was there that I had no idea would be in Kona. It was Cristian Bustos of Chile.
							He had outrun me and beaten me at a triathlon in Pucon, Chile earlier that year. In the
							ten-miles we ran there he outsplit me by five-minutes. Stinging! He was sitting at the
							athlete table when I arrived at the press conference. That was it. He was my biggest fear in
							the flesh! If he outran me at the same pace here in Kona, he could beat me by over
							thirteen-minutes. But the race in Chile was not the Ironman in Hawaii. I was hoping the
							tables would be turned and I’d just pull away from Cristian early in the race and never need
							to look back.
						</p>
						<p>
							That didn’t happen! We came off the bike together just like we had in Chile. Bustos put the
							pressure on from the first steps of the marathon. In the opening mile he built a gap of
							thirty-seconds. It took me another three miles before I was able to reel him in. I pulled up
							next to him. He took one look at me and upped it another notch! He knew he could outrun me
							and was not afraid to exploit that strength. I struggled to keep up with him. Bustos seemed
							just as comfortable pushing hard in Kona as he had been in Chile. It was clear he could win!
						</p>
						<p>
							Ironman is never easy but this was off the charts! I was running next to a guy who was not
							intimidated by my presence. The last person with that type of confidence was Dave Scott. It
							took me twenty-four miles of running before I was able to pull away from him. Bustos was so
							strong in that moment I didn’t think I had any hope holding his pace for more than another
							minute or two. I took a long deep breath and told myself to just stop thinking.
						</p>
						<p>
							There was no logical solution to this, and the thoughts I was telling myself were not
							helping! The dynamic changed the second I got my mind to be quiet. It got just slightly
							easier to match Cristian’s pace. A mile later I knew if I waited and let him wear down I
							could make a move. That took until we passed the half marathon point; even farther than the
							break happened with Greg Welch the previous year. The winning margin at the end was just
							over seven-minutes, nearly identical to the year before. But the pressure had been even
							greater.
						</p>
						<p>
							Winning looked impossible running next to Cristian in those opening miles. There was no
							strategy I could come up with that gave me any hope of being able to outrun him. There was
							no logical way to outrace a guy who had proven he could outrun me and who was clearly
							stronger than I was when we started the marathon. There was no thought I could come up with
							that bolstered my confidence.
						</p>
						<p>
							But then the lesson came. It was a simple one. Stop thinking! The intense fulcrum of the
							race finally started to tilt back in my direction the moment I was able to get my mind to be
							quiet. No analytical solution I could come up with was helping me do that. The place of no
							thought was where I needed to go to gain the strength I needed to keep going. It was the
							lesson learned and the place that eventually helped me become the IRONMAN World Champion for
							the fourth consecutive year!
