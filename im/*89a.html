				&ldquo;In a break from our format, this very special edition of the Ironman is presented in two sections. The "A" section was written, and has been acknowledged as the seminal piece on the race, and became the source for the much abused term "Iron War." This piece was written by CJ Olivares, once the editor at Triathlon Magazine with a passion for triathlon, an uncanny ability to capture the "story," and has gone on to a very successful career in television production. The "B" section is my account of the race from a very personal perspective. I hope you enjoy both.&rdquo;

<p>&quot;If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.&quot;  -Sun Tzu, Chinese General and author of The Art of War, circa 400-320 B.C.</p>

<p>In the last several years, Sun Tzu’s treatise, The Art of War, has been heralded by many as the most succinct work on the essentials for success in battle.  &quot;Sun Tzu’s truth can show the way to victory in all kinds of ordinary business conflicts, boardroom battles, and in the day to day fight for survival we all endure.  They are all forms of war, all fought under the same rules – his rules,&quot; writes James Clavell, author of Tai-Pan, Shogun, King Rat and Noble House, in his edition of the Sun Tzu work.</p>

<p>Like business and the &quot;fight for survival,&quot; athletic competition is also a form of warfare.  The objective of competitive sports is ultimately the same as that of business and war – victory.  In the case of business, victory toward increased wealth; in war, toward a greater peace and in sport, toward the title of champion.</p>

<p>Few triathletes who have taken on the challenge of Hawaii’s Bud Light Ironman Triathlon World Championship would argue at the comparison of that venerable event with war.  More often than not, however, the fight is a personal battle, a test of individual endurance.  In the course of that interminable day, spent marching up and down the bleak barren Kona coast, many brave men and women face the mental and physical extremes of a decade of &quot;normal&quot; living.</p>

   <div class="col-sm-8 pull-left"><p>At this year’s Ironman, however, the character of the event changed dramatically.  For the first time in its 11-year history, the Ironman was more a race than a survival contest, more a head-to-head battle than a war of attrition.  Two noble warriors locked into the intense battle that triathlon observers had expected for years.  Given this added dimension, Sun Tzu’s rules of engagement apply, now more than ever, to triathlon’s ultimate contest.</p>
   </div>
  <div class="col-sm-8 pull-left">
<p>Midway through the 1989 season, speculation about the possible winner of the 12th edition of the Ironman was void of any of the complex analysis that had occurred in prior years.  Two men had already displayed the kind of readiness that set them apart from the rest.  The only question that could be asked about the impending epic confrontation was simple.  Who will win, Dave Scott or Mark Allen?</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-8 pull-left">
<p>By the end of August, both men had chalked up their best seasons in years, and perhaps ever.  Dave Scott, with something to prove after the disappointment of withdrawing from the ’88 Ironman, showed uncharacteristic, early-season strength in his arsenal with a blistering run split at St. Croix.  The next week, he had a solid second-place finish behind Mark Allen at Australia’s World Cup Triathlon.  Scott’s summer progressed with a string of short-course victories and a stunning 8:01 performance at the Japan Ironman in July. &quot;The Man&quot; was back – stronger and faster than ever.</p>
</div>

		<div class="container">
		<div class="row-special">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
<p>Mark Allen had wasted no time either, building up momentum with strategic attacks at all distances.  St. Croix, the kick off of the pro season, set the wheels in motion, and was a big emotional win for Allen.  He followed it just a week later with an outstanding performance at the World Cup.  After contending with two flats on the bike in Australia, Allen effectively erased his deficit by the end of that segment, and proceeded to catch and drop Dave Scott on the run for the win.  Then, in May, he returned to Nice, France, after a two-year absence, to capture his sixth title there.  And like Scott, he too knocked off a few solid short-course victories along the way.  After his win at the World Championships in Avignon, France, Allen’s season appeared complete. However, one long-elusive victory lingered – the Ironman.</p>

<p>One would think that Allen’s 9 and 0 season leading up to Hawaii would have buoyed his confidence toward this final goal.  But Allen warns, &quot;When you come to the Ironman, you have to put everything you’ve done before it in the garbage can; it all means zero.&quot;</p>

<p>With memories of several decidedly unpleasant performances in Hawaii haunting him, Allen felt a new strategy was necessary.  He embraced aspects of Dave Scott’s approach to the Ironman.  &quot;…Dave once said, ‘racing changes after six hours.’  I talked to Scott Molina after he won here last year, and I realized that this really is a different event.  A six-hour training day doesn’t prepare you for an eight-hour race.  Only an eight-hour training day prepares you for that…Dave has also said that the race doesn’t start until you hit the turnaround and you’ve got 10 miles to go.  I thought a lot about that when I was training.&quot;</p>

<p>For Dave Scott, the strategy was simpler.  His experience at the Ironman is superior to anyone else’s.  Essentially, all he had to do was go out and race hard.  &quot;I wanted to get away from everyone on the swim.  Not ahead of the leaders, but at least get a little distance on Mark and Pigg and some of the others.  After that, I felt controlling the pace on the bike would be important.  But ultimately, I knew that it would come down to the run.&quot;</p>

<p>As much as everyone was expecting it to be a two-man race, the gathering of the top U.S. and international talent, perhaps the best in the race’s history, was impressive. It promised, at the very least, to create an interesting set of obstacles for the two favorites.  The squadron of contenders:  Scott Tinley, Mike Pigg, Ken Glah, Ray Browning, Ken Souza, Jeff Devlin, and Rob Mackle from the U.S.; Rob Barel from Holland; Yves Cordier and Eric Plantin from France; Dirk Aschmoneit, Wolfgang Dittrich and Jurgen Zack from West Germany; Hideya Miyazuka and Toshi Nakayama from Japan; Pauli Kiuru from Finland; Greg Stewart, Greg Welch and Rod Cedaro from Australia; and Christian Bustos from Chile.  In all there were 46 countries represented in the 1,286-strong field.</p>

<p>The women’s field, contrastingly, offered an abundance of question marks.  Paula Newby-Fraser was back to defend her title and prove that her ’88 record-setting effort was no fluke.  But she was a dubious favorite, with an unstellar season casting a shadow on her chances in Hawaii, Newby-Fraser’s only real rival in’88 had been Erin Baker, but her obvious absence (she had held out for the Chicago Marathon) left the list of serious contenders wide open.</p>

<p>The other woman to win the Ironman more than once, Sylviane Puntous, had raced well enough in the early season to chalk up the points to challenge for the overall title in the Coke Grand Prix.  However, Puntous’ performances in later months indicated that she might be burning out.</p>

<p>Jan Ripple, who led the IFET rankings and was third in the Coke rankings going into the Ironman, was having her best season ever.  But with memories of her DNF in ’88 and her much-televised crawl-fest in ’87, many were suspect of Ripple’s effectiveness in the Hawaiian heat.</p>

<p>The wild-card contender was Kirsten Hanssen.  In 1988, Hanssen’s third-place, first-time effort at the event was overshadowed by the record-breaking race between Newby-Fraser and Baker, but it had impressed observers none the less.  For Hanssen, most of the ’89 season was a reminder of the delicacy of the human body.  Slow-mending injuries resulted in a checkered race record and no major wins.  Exactly where others like Lisa Laiti, Sue Latshaw, Jan Wanklyn, Tina Bishoff and Julie Wilson figured into the running was uncertain.</p>



<p>The Monday before the Ironman, things weren’t normal in Kona.  Gale swept waters off the Kailua Pier churned to a white froth. Swells above average in size pounded the lava seawall adjacent to Dig-Me Beach.  Undaunted by the conditions, dozens of triathletes jumped into the choppy mess for their daily training swims. Out on Queen Kaahumanu Highway, the wind blew all day too, as scores more athletes spun up and down the unseasonable cool coast between Kona and Hawi.  Along Alii Drive, the slapping of hundreds of sweat-soaked running shoes echoed off the pavement under oddly overcast skies.</p>

<p>It was &quot;Ironman Week&quot; again, and the dynamic energy of thousands of athletes who had trekked to triathlon mecca seemed to overflow into nature, disrupting the usual environmental conditions.  As each day passed, however, the mild weather crept a few degrees closer to the recognizable Kona blast furnace that everyone feared and loathed.  By race day, the winds had disappeared, the swells had dropped and the clouds had floated away.  Things were as they should be once again in the sleepy resort village.</p>

<p>At dawn’s first light on race morning, the air was still and warm.  The street in front of the pier was swarming with athletes and spectators.  After being tattooed with Marks-A lot pens and checking their bikes one last time, the competitors gave their well-wishers a final farewell and moved nervously toward the water.</p>

<p>Shortly after 7 a.m., while Dave Scott adjusted his swim goggles, Hawaii’s Governor, John Waihee, fired the start canon prematurely, sending the mass of athletes out to sea.  Scott was caught off guard by the quick start, later saying, &quot;That was my worst start ever.&quot;  And &quot;The Man&quot; wasn’t the only one surprised.  Fifty or so athletes were still warming up beyond the actual start line.  With 23.4 miles of swimming ahead, however, the mix-up wasn’t about to cause any permanent damage.</p>

<p>Forty-eight minutes and 13 seconds later, when Wolfgang Dittrich and Rob Mackle scampered up the finish ramp in the lead, it was obvious that the distance had been enough to equalize any unfair advantages gained form the unusual start.  Within three minutes, Dave Scott stepped onto the ramp, with Mark Allen just off his shoulder.  Mike Pigg was a stride behind them, with Yves Cordier, Rob Barel and Ken Glah in tow.</p>

<p>Almost as fast as they’d run into the changing tent, they were all out again and heading for their bikes.  Dittrich, in the meantime, was out on Queen &quot;K&quot; Highway giving ABC’s cameras a show.  The German was flying up the rollercoaster asphalt ribbon at a healthy clip, one that would actually add to his lead by the turnaround.  Mackle was drifting back to the chase group of Scott, Allen, Pigg and Glah.</p>

<p>By the time the group caught Mackle, the pace had settled considerably, with Dave Scott out in front, playing the point man.  &quot;I felt there were several times when people made a move,&quot; described Scott, &quot;But someone always answered it.  I was usually in the lead.  Kenny Glah was there, Mike Pigg came up too.  I could never see Mark.  Most of the time, it was just me.  I like that position.  I like to dictate.  It worries me if someone puts 100 yards on me.  All of the sudden I’ll feel extremely tired.  I would just as soon have that position and keep applying pressure, and hopefully they’re going to drop off.</p>

<p>While Scott perceived he was &quot;applying pressure,&quot; Allen saw things a bit differently.  &quot;It never seemed like there was a point when anything significant was happening,&quot; Allen said after the race, adding &quot;And there’s really no reason to out bike Dave, ‘cause he’ll just catch you on the run.&quot;</p>

<p>Sun Tzu: &quot;All warfare is based on deception.  Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable.  Pretend to be weak, that your opponent may grow arrogant.&quot;</p>

<p>Ten or so minutes to the rear, the women’s race was taking shape.  Paula Newby-Fraser, Jan Ripple, Kirsten Hanssen and, for a short time, Lisa Laiti, rode toward Hawi within a hundred feet of one another.  The Puntous twins were several minutes back.</p>

<p>As Hawi neared, Newby-Fraser and Hanssen pulled away, exchanging the lead, &quot;I was keeping a steady pace on the bike,&quot; recounted Newby-Fraser.  Eventually, Hanssen began to fade.  And Ripple had essentially been knocked out of the race with a mechanical problem that sidelined her for more than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>To everyone’s surprise, Dittrich was still in the lead past the 90-mile point.  The scene behind him, however, started to change.  Glah, who had made a brief break from the chase group after Hawi, was feeling some negative effects from that effort.  &quot;I threw up three times coming back toward town,&quot; said Glah, &quot;and lost a minute.&quot;</p>

<p>Rolling into the transition area, Dave Scott was pretty much where he expected to be, just in front of Mark Allen.  Dittrich was a minute and a half up the run course at that point.  Pigg was 10 seconds back, with Mackle on his heels.  Scott had had a sliver of a hope that he could put some time on Allen and the others on the bike and then avoid a head-to-head struggle on the run.  &quot;But,&quot; as he related later, &quot;I felt as though realistically that wasn’t going to happen, and it didn’t happen.  I kind of knew it would come down to the run, and I felt the only guy that could run with me was Mark Allen.&quot;</p>

<p>Mark Allen’s preparation for this situation had been thorough.  &quot;I did a lot of overdistance training with Ken Souza.  When I got off the bike, I felt like I’d only ridden 40 miles, instead of 112.  That was a big, big difference.  Usually, when I get off the bike, I feel like I’ve ridden 150, and that I’ve got to hold it together for a marathon.&quot;</p>

<p>With a crowd of photographers hovering at the top of the hill above the Kona Surf, Dave Scott and Mark Allen charged up shoulder to Shoulder, marching toward some final conflict in the lava fields.  And once they blew by Dittrich near the three-mile mark, they would be alone again, as they had been in ’86 and ’87, to fight for the Ironman title.</p>

<p>Sun Tzu: &quot;To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.&quot;</p>

<p>Each mile passed and neither man showed signs of weakness, though Allen was having some problems.  &quot;It was really difficult at first, said Allen later.  &quot;But once I got comfortable with the feeling that I was going to be running next to him for 20 or so miles, it was alright to just be there, hang out and go through the aid stations with him.&quot;</p>

<p>And Allen made use of Scott’s previous efforts in Hawaii.  &quot;Dave has had the most success over here.  There’s nobody that knows how to pace as well as him.  I’ve tried pulling away on the bike.  I’ve been a little more patient and pulled away early on the run, neither of those worked.  So, I thought I’d just stay with him longer.&quot;</p>

<p>Aid stations came and went, and despite the fact that neither Scott nor Allen was making a break, the twosome’s lead on the rest of the field extended.  &quot;I think we were both hesitant to make a move,&quot; remembered Scott.  &quot;But we knew at that point, after doing this race a couple of times, to be patient.  I felt as though it would come down to the last two miles.&quot;</p>

<p>The skies had grown overcast by the time they hit the turnaround, and Allen was solidifying his plan of attack and beginning to marshal his forces:  &quot;It was pretty comfortable for me through the turnaround.  But I knew that things were going to change a bit then.  And basically, Dave just picked it up mile, after mile, after mile.&quot;</p>

<p>Sun Tzu: &quot;At first exhibit the shyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterward emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.&quot;</p>

<p>Heading back toward Kona, amid a huge entourage of press motorcycles and trucks, Allen began to test Scott: &quot;Dave seemed to run really well on the down grades, but on the up grades he wasn’t quite as strong.  I thought I’d try to hold the pace a little stronger on the hills to see how he responded.  He was always behind me.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, it was time for Allen to put his final phase into effect.  &quot;I thought, ‘where’s the best uphill?’  Well, the best one is that mile back up into town.  I started to push a little bit before then, just to see again how he was feeling.  Then, when we got to the 99-mile marker for the bike, just at the bottom of the hill, I said to myself, ‘this is it.’  I felt really good, like I could go really hard for two miles . . . I had thought about that moment in the race all week.&quot;</p>

<p>Dave Scott had begun to sense trouble.  &quot;I had a problem getting several aid passes.  Then, at mile 23, it happened again and I fell back about 20 feet.  It really took some punch out of me to catch Mark again.  I told myself I’ve gotta come back, then it hurt to come back.  Once I got up to him again, I said, ‘okay, I’m back in the race.’  I hadn’t been with him for more than five or six strides when he made a move.  It was at the base of the grade coming up the long hill, at about 24 miles.  He took off, left me.  And I just couldn’t answer . . . He had waited to move until he felt he could break me.&quot;</p>

<p>Sun Tzu: He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.&quot;</p>

<p>Mark Allen, looked over his shoulder, just to make sure that Dave Scott was really gone.  Scott felt the energy drain from his legs and his emotions wane.  Allen didn’t look back again.  It seemed neither of them had paid much attention to time.  They knew they were moving fast, but how fast was irrelevant.  As &quot;The Grip&quot; closed in on the finish, however, he realized that he was somewhere in the vicinity of a 2:40-marathon, and, more importantly, that he was going to win the Ironman.  Thrusting an American flag into the air, he ran the final stretch to the finish, with a deafening roar from the crowd to bring him in.  He crossed the line in 8:09:15, shattering Dave Scott’s three-year-old record by 19 minutes and 22 seconds.</p>

<p>Out in the lava field, Paula Newby-Fraser was repeating her performance from the previous year, having come off the bike with a three-minute-50-second lead on Hanssen and 10:42 ahead of Sylviane Puntous.  &quot;I was conservative for the first five or six miles on the run.&quot; Said the ’88 champion.  &quot;I didn’t worry about what anybody else was doing.  You have to run your own race, according to how you feel.  I maintained a pace that was comfortable for me the whole way, so that I wouldn’t have to walk through the aid stations.&quot;</p>

<p>Newby-Fraser’s &quot;comfortable&quot; pace brought her back to the Kailua pier un-contested by any female, in 9:00:56, with a run split of 3:05:37, both times bettered the course records she set the previous year.  At the finish line, she speculated about the 56 seconds she was short of a sub-nine-hour Ironman.  She finally accounted it to a stop she made to rip and injured toenail off her foot. &quot;It was pretty much gone anyway, &quot; she said philosophically.</p>

<p>But of her victory, she said, &quot;It’s sweeter this year.  It’s the third one and no other woman has done that.  Also, being able to go as fast as I went last year proves that it wasn’t a fluke.  A lot of people questioned it.&quot;  No one will be questioning Paula Newby-Fraser anymore.</p>

<p>For those who successfully wage their personal wars on the battle field that is the Ironman, difficult questions are often answered, queries of the self that can be resolved in no other arena are clarified.  But for those who do not scale the highest heights of their goals in Hawaii, some questions haunt.</p>

<p>For Mark Allen, there would be no more doubts about the Ironman: &quot;This race put a lot to rest inside of me.  The only reason I got into triathlons was to do this event.  And after the first year, I thought, jeez, maybe I could do well in it.  And after my second time, getting third, I thought, maybe I could win it.  And now here I am.  This race creates a lot of mental barriers.  I learned a lot about them when Dave and I were running together.  Usually, I can feel a weakness when I’m next to people.  But Dave was like a rock.  I think I’ve gained some of that special knowledge that Dave has about this race.  It’s not something you can put your finger on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Dave’s accomplishment of winning the Ironman six times will never be diminished by anything anyone else ever does here . . . The Ironman is Dave’s race, he owns it.  Anyone who can beat him here is only borrowing it for the day.&quot;</p>

<p>Sun Tzu: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.&quot;</p>
