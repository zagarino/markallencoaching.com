				From the first race of the season on Australia’s Gold Coast imperfections started bubbling to the surface. My preparation had gotten a slow start. Hope and a winning streak that I had going could only carry me so far. Outside magazine had placed me on the cover leading into that first event with the tag “Astral Jock: Why No One Can Beat This Man.” Maybe I believed my own headlines, but none of my competitors did. A scrappy powerhouse named Mike Pigg ended up handing me my first defeat in almost three years. And that was just the beginning!

						I was playing catch up with my fitness all season. By late summer things were still feeling imperfect as Kona’s booming presence weighed on me. I pushed training just over the line where commitment ends and obsession begins with the result of a hamstring seizing up during a track workout in early August. A week later I had my final prep before Hawaii, a half Ironman in Texas. Imperfection won big. I was forced out a mile into the run. Greg Welch, the very athlete who finished third behind Dave and me in 1989, won the race. He would be in Hawaii. He was strong!

					</p>
					<p>
						I could swim fast in training. I could cycle as hard as I wanted. But during the last months before the Ironman I was reduced to running no faster than 8-minute miles to prevent my hamstring from tearing. It was better than nothing, but clearly not what I was hoping to log going into the biggest race of my season. 
					</p>
					<p>
Texas seemed to be a foreshadowing. Welch was even stronger in Kona. My swim was faster than his, but his bike faster than mine. I started the run in his shadow; full well knowing that running at race pace might completely rip my still piano string tight hamstring. I took a stride. It tightened. I took the next. It tightened a bit more. I took the third stride. It unlocked and swung free! Imperfection left and possibility seeped in.					
</p>
					<p>
					Welch set the pace through town. But Palani Rd hill shortened his stride, and it never quite opened back up. The next twenty miles in the lava was like coming home for me. My stride loosened even further and a break happened that Welch never closed. In the end I opened up a six-minute gap and completed a third victory on a day when at its start I had absolutely no idea if my body would allow me to finish. Imperfect yes, but perfection as only life can script it.
