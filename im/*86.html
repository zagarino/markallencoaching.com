Nice had become my territory, much like the Ironman was clearly Dave Scott’s turf. I could beat him in Nice. I could beat everyone in Nice. But Dave had claim to what was in reality was the biggest race in our sport.	</p>

						Nice being two weeks before Kona was far from enough recovery time to even consider doing the Ironman. The run in Nice was 32km, essentially a 20-mile run. That in theory would take close to three weeks to recover from. I had to choose: Nice or Hawaii. My legacy was building in Nice, a race I had already won four times going into 1986. I had zero victories in Kona, and the last race there was a survival contest for me. So my focus was clear. France it was, then a vacation in Hawaii to watch the Ironman! 
					</p>
					<p>
						I flew straight from Nice to Kauai where I planned a week just recovering before going on to Kona. By the end of that week I was feeling really, really good! An idea began to percolate. Maybe I should race in Kona a week later. I did a 2-hour run with the intention of testing my legs. They felt solid enough to tip the scales in favor of racing. I called up the pro coordinator and was in! 
					</p>
					<p>
The Ironman in Hawaii is not really the best race on the planet to decide to do at the last minute if you are considering the outcome to be anything other than a finish. I was hoping that by some stroke of luck my recovery from Nice as well as my fitness would be enough to carry me to the top of the podium. Well, we can all have our fantasy days in our minds at least! 					
</p>
					<p>
					I did finish. It was second, my highest placing ever in Hawaii. But I was never a true contender for the crown that day. Dave was out of the water seven seconds ahead of me, which is small but I could tell he was just toying with me. He outsplit me on the bike by just under a minute, again with the feeling like he had no concern that I was that close. His run was over six minutes faster than mine. It may as well have been an hour faster because there was absolutely nothing special in my legs that gave them a whisper of hope to hold his pace or consider closing the gap. I was more tired from Nice than I had been willing to admit before the day started.  
					</p>
					<p>
						But it was my highest finish ever, even without targeting Hawaii as my main focus of the season. Now there’s only one spot left for me to go up to! The next year would be different.
