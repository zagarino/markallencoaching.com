				WHAT COULD GO WRONG? 
			</h3>

				&ldquo;Disappointment from my previous five Hawaiian Ironman races was blocking me from making the changes I needed to put in place if I was to have any chance of winning. I was relying on hope to be the secret sauce that would carry me to victory in 1988. And that one ingredient skyrocketed two days before that year’s event with some unexpected news from Dave Scott.&rdquo;

				He was out of the race! Dave had been struggling with some knee issues that year and ultimately decided that racing was not in the cards for him. I heard the news. I looked at the start roster. I had beaten every other athlete racing who had any hope of winning. Anything short of disaster and I knew this would be the year of my first championship win!
But disaster it was. It was a slow seeping disaster that added up to scripting another disappointment of immeasurable proportions. After a smooth and predictable swim, I flatted in the opening miles of the bike. Okay, that was something I was prepared to handle. I rode tubulars and always carried two spares for Kona. I figured I had never flatted ever on The Big Island even in training, so two would be more than ample.

							That change was not smooth, though. I had glued the tire onto my race rims over a month before, which was enough time to make the bond between tire and rim be like cement. After a few minutes frustratingly prying at the tire with sweating hands I threw the wheel down on the pavement in disgust. Okay, calm yourself!			 I picked it back up and gave it a superhuman effort of two thumbs. It gave just slightly, then let loose. The tire came off. I put on the spare, inflated it with my CO2 canister and was off.

						</p>
						<p>
							Be calm! A few miles later, after closing back in on the field I got round two of disaster. My rear flatted again. I had succeeded in running over probably the only two pieces of broken glass on the entire Queen K Hwy. This change only took about a minute since there was no glue to hold the process up. Off I road, still with the hope that today would be my day.
						</p>
						<p>
							But no! At around mile 75 of the bike I was bouncing off the rim of yet another tire that had lost enough air to compress it into nothingness with each pedal stroke. Now I had no spare. It took over 15-minutes for the support vehicle that helps all athletes who have problems on the bike to find me and give me a new wheel to ride, one where only about half the gears worked with my derailleur.
						</p>
						<p>
							I finished the bike, totally disheartened. Two miles into the run I was struggling at terminal velocity. I spotted my dad cheering me on along the course hoping to bolster my moral. I told him I was done. I stopped running. I was finished. We walked for a few minutes together toward the hotel that I was staying at, not exchanging a word.
Then something changed. In that silence I started to realize that I still had what it took to finish, and at the Ironman in Hawaii that is the first and most pressing calling for anyone who starts the race. I knew I could do that! I had an obligation to the bigger picture of the race, to the Island and to myself to fulfill that one vision. I told my dad I’d see him at the finish line and started to run again.
						</p>
						Fifth was where I ended up, farther out of the lead than any of my other Ironman finishes on a day when I thought it would be mine for the taking. My marathon split was the only one under 3-hours, but that was of little solace.
This was my sixth Hawaiian Ironman. Every one of those years I seemed to be fighting an unseen force that was crippling my potential. I had a different outcome in mind than the reality of how each of those days ended up unfolding. These were not trivial setbacks. They were shattering, devastating. They were cataclysmic in their effect on my very DNA. At the time I viewed them like I had been injected with some life-altering poison. But in a year’s time I would see that the forces of life, of these races, were forcing me to make a choice that would change my life forever in the most amazing way, one that would have never happened if things gone according to my ideal plan!
