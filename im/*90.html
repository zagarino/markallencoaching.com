				IRONMAN 1990 | On A Roll 
			</h3>
			<p>
				&ldquo;My career was on a roll. I hadn’t lost a race since my three-flat Ironman in 1988. After that I won everything I entered including my first victory at the IRONMAN World Championship in October 1989. To be honest, I could have very easily called it a career and retired right then. Fortunately there was another part of me that was curious. Was it a fluke? Could I win it again? I had to find out!  &rdquo;

				This year’s championship came with an unexpected twist. Once again Dave Scott would not line up on race day, his second no-start in three years. In 1988 his absence lulled me into believing my victory was guaranteed. I would not repeat that mistake! I’d race like every competitor out there was Dave Scott, quite the opposite from two years earlier when I thought I had it in the bag without him.

			My swim was strong. My bike split even better. It was the best in the field by over three-minutes. But I knew the marathon was the key for me. Without a solid run beginning to end someone else could still own the day.  
				</p>
				<p>
			I took off on the run head down and pacing it to build over the entire 26.2 miles. I’d learned pacing from Scott in 1989 racing side by side with him for nearly the entire marathon. I’d learned how to push, but I also how to be steady and build. No one would see heroics from me in the first thirteen miles. It was a lesson learned the hard way many times over! But by the half marathon point I seemed to be in my own universe out in the lead and unchallenged. </p>

				<p>The run course had changed. For the very first time we ran into the brutal heat and desolation of the Energy Lab. Going in was the easy part with a slight downgrade and a headwind coming off the ocean that cooled me just a bit. Coming out was supremely intense with a long unforgiving upgrade made even more lethal by a tailwind blowing at exactly the same speed I was running, which provided zero amount of cooling. My core temperature started to skyrocket. But momentum was carrying my legs through the survival override switch that was trying to get me to slow down.  
				</p>

				<p>
				I surged back out onto the Queen K Hwy where the breeze was just enough to my side to start cooling me with the sweat covering every inch of my body. No one was close enough to contest me for the lead. The remaining six miles to finish seemed like a welcoming friend. For years I’d looked out at that same stretch of lava almost wanting to yell out, “WHY! Why does it have to be so brutal and stark and unforgiving out here?”  
				</p>
				<p>
				This year I looked out over that exact same lava and saw beauty because it was so raw. I felt how its intensity was critical for teaching me how to be strong, how to keep going until I left struggling and the sense of impending disaster behind. It taught me that if I hung in there long enough and gave all I had that everything in front of me would feel like running toward freedom and awe rather than trying to outrun fear and doubt. The lava through its intensity was crafting the greatness of this amazing day. I saw how anything less intense and vast and the Ironman would just be another race.				
				</p>
				<p>
				The final 10k defined the race for me that year. I’d led the Ironman before at that point, but never really knowing if the lead would be enough. I didn’t take the lead the year before until the closing moments of the run, and really only had the stretch along Ali’i Drive where I could embrace the experience, the feeling of leading one of the greatest races in endurance athletics. 
This year was different. It was humbling. I felt like I was opening the doorway that would make the day possible for everyone else follow and fulfill their dreams. It was like I had the honor of clearing the path for our sport to be another degree greater, to write the first words in the next chapter in triathlon history. It was not personal. It was for everyone.

				I gave everything I had. That was my way of trying to honor the position of leading the greatest race in our sport. And I had that last 10k to soak in the depth of what it takes to win in Kona. It’s not just a race of numbers and splits. It’s so much more. It’s human. It’s emotion. It’s spiritual. I could feel the complexity of the race and the demand of performing at my best on the Island of Hawaii. I felt the privilege of leading every step of those final six-miles.
					<p>
I won my second IRONMAN World Championship that day. Two-time IRONMAN World Champion Scott Tinley came in second. My winning margin of 9:33 would be the greatest of all my Ironman victories. This became my 21st straight triathlon win since the streak started in late October of 1988. That string would become part of my legacy along with my Ironman victories. The streak would eventually end as all do. But for the moment I allowed myself to bask in its blessings.				</p>
