				<p style="margin-top: 50px;">In 1987 the only plan I could come up with to
				be better was to just work harder. That goal ended up with training that
				added up to logging almost 15,000 miles of swimming, cycling and running by
				race day. For sure some of that was an attempt to get my body stronger and
				fitter. But a lot of it was just a haphazard attempt to mask the paralysis
				I felt when I really thought about placing myself back in Hawaii on that
				demanding course against the most demanding foe ever, Dave Scott. It was a
				crushing memory. It could happen. The competition? Dave Scott swooped in
				and made his mark regardless of what anyone threw at him. I had no
				intension of doing Ironman in 1986, but at the last second things
				changed.</p>

						<p>My focus swung to other races that year. Most notable was the Nice
						International Triathlon, which in 1986 took place only two weeks before
						the Ironman in Hawaii. I would do Nice then go to Kona, but as a
						spectator. The atmosphere around Kona during race week was magical and
						even though I wasn’t going to race, I looked forward to being there.</p>
						<p>The Nice International Triathlon had become my</p>

					<p> territory, much like
						the Ironman was Dave Scott’s turf. By the time I set foot in Kona that
						year I’dwon my fifth consecutive title in Nice. And with only two weeks between
					the two great races I had to decide which it would be. France took
					precedent. I flew straight from Nice to Kauai where I planned a week just
					recovering before going on to Kona. By the end of that week I was feeling
					surprisingly good! An idea began to percolate. Maybe I should race in Kona
					a week later. I did a two-hour run with the intention of testing my legs
					the weekend before Kona. They felt solid enough to tip the scales in favor
					of racing. I called up the pro coordinator and was in. The Ironman in
					Hawaii is about the last race on the planet anyone should decide to do at
					the last minute but I was there, I was feeling well recovered, so why
					not!</p>
					<p>There was also this background fantasy in my head saying that maybe
					since I had absolutely no pressure on me I might be able to pull off a
					miracle and beat Dave Scott. That was a naïve fantasy though. I didn’t
					intimidate Scott even when I was in peak shape for Kona. Doing it on a
					lark did even less to make him shake in his boots. Well, we can all have
					our fantasy days in our minds at least!</p>
					<p>Dave Scott was out of the water seven seconds ahead of me, which is
					small but I could tell he was just toying with me. He outsplit me on the
					bike by just under a minute, again with the feeling like he had no concern
					that I was close. His run was over six minutes faster than mine.</p>

					<p>It may as well have been an hour faster because there was absolutely
					nothing special in my legs that gave me a whisper of a hope of holding his
					pace or closing the gap. I was more tired from Nice than I had been
					willing to admit before the day started.</p>
					<p>I knew it was important for me to try to learn how to do that race
					better under the most extreme competitive conditions. This year didn’t
					teach me that. But it did reignite the idea that maybe I could be the
					champion. Second place in a race that I did as a second thought seemed to
					point the needle in that direction. But I knew I still needed to learn how
					to really race the Ironman. Not survive it. Not just finish it. But race
					it!</p>
					<p>I did finish though. I was second, my highest placing ever in Hawaii at
					that point. But I had never been a true contender for the crown. This may
					sound odd, but I’m still not sure if it was a wise move to do the race.
					Indeed it was my highest finish ever, even without having Hawaii be my
					main focus for the season. But I still couldn’t tell what might happen if
					real pressure was put on Scott. I still didn’t know where the upper
					boundary on going hard was for me before it would become too much and I’d
					blow up. 1986 was a solid effort, but a tired one. No outer limits were
					tested.</p>
