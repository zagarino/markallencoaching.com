						&ldquo;I began a career as a professional triathlete in 1982. Back then doing a triathlon was a big adventure. There were no books, no videos, no coaches. But there were races, some even had prize money. The challenge was how to go faster. One month we might think the key was mileage, so we’d crank out ridiculous totals week after week. Swim 30,000 yards in seven days? Of course! Pile on 500 miles cycling and another 70 running in that same time? Why not! Was that enough? Was it too much? It was all a guess. As soon as one person tried something different and did better than before in even a single race, we’d all follow the “new” approach.&rdquo;

If something worked, I kept it in my program. If it didn’t make me stronger and faster I dropped it. In the end I developed what proved to be extremely effective ways to reach new heights year after year.

There have been huge gains in technology since the early years of triathlons to help athletes measure and quantify a lot of elements of getting fit and racing fast that I had to be figure out by simply tuning into my body.

								my body. But every piece of the core training wisdom that I used is still the same. Our genetics have not changed a whole lot since 1982! Those basic workout necessities can seem repetitive. They can look fairly simple on the surface, but it’s an art form to bring out the upper limits of what you are capable of. And that can only be learned over an entire career if you are trying to figure it out on your own, or of course in much less time if someone shows you how!

My efforts started to focus on other races, most notably the Nice International Triathlon, which in 1986 took place only two weeks before the Ironman. I was going to just go watch the race in Hawaii while I recovered from what became my fifth title in Nice, but then something changed...

								In late March of 1992 I embarked on a solo Ironman-focused training ride: flat and hopefully fast. I was not into it. I went through an intersection. My mind was wandering. A truck accelerated and turned right into me. It smashed my body and my bike. I flew through the air then crumpled to the ground.

								Going into this year’s Ironman I was sitting at four World Championship titles. Each of those was earned against a different competitor who pushed me beyond limits I never thought I could surpass. This year would be no exception...

								Sometimes the greatest clarity comes to me when I step back and can view my world from a distance. In 1994 I did not race in Kona. I was there to watch for the first time. What I saw shocked me...

								This was it! My final Ironman. There had never been a decision I had made that I was more sure of. But with that finality came risk. If the day went south, there would be no redemption, and with an unusually depleted physical state that summer, there looked to be very little chance of the race going anything like I was hoping for...
