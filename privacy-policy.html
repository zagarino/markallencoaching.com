We have suggested some common categories.<br>As a general rule, where you plan to use personal information you have collected for the purpose of direct marketing, this should be made clear on the page where the information is collected, and you should ensure that this only happens if users opt in to the marketing (eg "Click here if you would like us to send you information by email about products which we think will interest you.").
