						Everybody Hurts
					</div>
					<p>A brief note about our corporate point of view regarding the people we coach. After I had
					won the 1990 Ironman I upheld the tradition where the winner comes back to the finish line to
					cheer in the final finishers. As luck would have it, standing next me that night was Scott
					Tinley who has never lacked for a unique point of view. He turned to me just before the final
					finisher arrived after having been on the course for 17 hours, and said; "I could never race
					for 17 hours, these people humble me every year." That stuck with me and as we enter our 2.0
					phase our point of view is that there are only two things that separate me going 8:09 and one
					of our team going 16:59 at an Ironman distance race, or any race for that matter. The first is
					genetics, most of the people you see standing on podiums should be very thankful that they
					were awarded a genetic makeup that made them faster than everyone they started with almost
					immediately. The second is that my coaches and I have raced a combined total of almost 800
					triathlons at every distance, across every terrain, so the difference is experience. We can't
					give you genetics, but we can give you the benefit of our experience, and believe me every
					triathlete who finishes their race hurts every bit as bad as we did, you guys just endure it
					longer.</p>

									schedule to enable you to hit your key races in peak condition.</p>
									<p class="c-card-content">One of the great advantages to having guidance throughout the
									entire season is that you will likely be able to go through all phases of training twice
									in the same year. This provides a significant advantage of allowing you to vary the
									training stimulus enough to be able to build your overall fitness as the year progresses.
									Once through the three main phases of training (base building, speedwork and tapering) is
									fantastic in itself, going through those phases twice in the same season supercharges your
									fitness and your results!</p>
