			 <p>All Mark Allen Coaching training programs can be as long as 20-weeks in length. However, for those who have less time to commit to their focused training and for those who want to get their feet wet with Mark Allen Coaching, the Fast Option is an ideal starting point.</p>

<p>You can create schedules that are less than 20-weeks in length, or even make ones up to that length without a 20-week commitment. Fast is designed to help you get complete guidance in your training and pay month to month. We say Fast because even a training program that is only a couple of months in length will almost always help make a significant positive shift in your fitness and race performances.</p>

<p>Essentially, the fast course is the fundamentals of putting together a successful and time effective triathlon training progra. Whether it's your first race, or your 10th Ironman, beieve me when I say that our team has been to a lot of races, and we always marvel at the mistakes people are going to have to endure but for understanding the fundamentals of putting a program together. We make sure you're not one of them.</p>

A solid six-month commitment to getting better that will afford you the chance to train smarter, go faster, and move up in the rankings in less time than you're probably dedicating to your training now.

For me, winning Ironman in October was initiated with a plan well thought out before the first steps of training were taken in January, and all made possible with smart off season maintenance work prior to it, which I always thought of more as a plan to improve, than just time off. <span style="color:#ED2418">Fastest</span> is that same commitment to personal excellence made by you.

						Everybody Hurts
					</div>
					<p>A brief note about our corporate point of view regarding the people we coach. After I had
					won the 1990 Ironman I upheld the tradition where the winner comes back to the finish line to
					cheer in the final finishers. As luck would have it, standing next me that night was Scott
					Tinley who has never lacked for a unique point of view. He turned to me just before the final
					finisher arrived after having been on the course for 17 hours, and said; "I could never race
					for 17 hours, these people humble me every year." That stuck with me and as we enter our 2.0
					phase our point of view is that there are only two things that separate me going 8:09 and one
					of our team going 16:59 at an Ironman distance race, or any race for that matter. The first is
					genetics, most of the people you see standing on podiums should be very thankful that they
					were awarded a genetic makeup that made them faster than everyone they started with almost
					immediately. The second is that my coaches and I have raced a combined total of almost 800
					triathlons at every distance, across every terrain, so the difference is experience. We can't
					give you genetics, but we can give you the benefit of our experience, and believe me every
					triathlete who finishes their race hurts every bit as bad as we did, you guys just endure it
					longer.</p>

									<p class="c-card-content">With the <span style="color:#ED261A">FASTER</span> option you
									have a solid six-months of training that you can line up. Within that time there is
									flexibility in how you structure your coaching. If you are in your race season, that is
									enough tie to go through all of the phases of training to get ready for a race (base
									building, speedwork and tapering). You can also combine some off-season Maintenance
									Program training with the Peak Performance racing programs in a six-month period.</p>
									<p class="c-card-content">This is enough time to really allow your physiology to make
									significant shifts and to balance out the development of all the energy systems that allow
									you to have great races from Sprint distance triathlons all the way up to Ironman distance
									races.</p>

									<p class="c-card-content">The <span style="color:#ED261A">FASTEST</span> option gives you
									a full year’s guidance in your training. This includes both in season <span style=
									"color:#ED261A">Peak Performance</span> training plans as well as <span style=
									"color:#ED261A">Off Season Maintenance</span> programs. It also affords you the ability to
									really plan out your season and base all of the training programs around your race
									schedule to enable you to hit your key races in peak condition.</p>
									<p class="c-card-content">One of the great advantages to having guidance throughout the
									entire season is that you will likely be able to go through all phases of training twice
									in the same year. This provides a significant advantage of allowing you to vary the
									training stimulus enough to be able to build your overall fitness as the year progresses.
									Once through the three main phases of training (base building, speedwork and tapering) is
									fantastic in itself, going through those phases twice in the same season supercharges your
									fitness and your results!</p>

						<p>This option, also fully customizable to include recovery from injury or other health
						issues, is designed to help you recover in the time after an injury, at a time when you're
						just plain burned out, or in what little off-season our sport has now. It is also great if
						you are transitioning into the sport and ready to test the waters with triathlon training. It
						will also get you ready to move into the Peak Performance programs when the time is right.
						The majority of the sessions are aerobic, but you will receive some tempo work at key times.
						The Maintenance Programs also come with unlimited email support for any questions you have
						during your training.</p>
						<p>For the next 30 days, all training programs at Mark Allen Coaching come with the
