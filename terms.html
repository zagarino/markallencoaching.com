Law and jurisdiction<br>19.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A contract under these terms and conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with [English law].<br>19.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any disputes relating to a contract under these terms and conditions shall be subject to the [exclusive / non-exclusive] jurisdiction of the courts of [England].<br>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statutory and regulatory disclosures<br>20.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are registered in [trade register]; you can find the online version of the register at [URL], and our registration number is [number].<br>20.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are subject to [authorisation scheme], which is supervised by [supervisory authority].<br>20.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are registered as [title] with [professional body] in [the United Kingdom] and are subject to [rules], which can be found at [URL].<br>20.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We subscribe to [code(s) of conduct], which can be consulted electronically at [URL(s)].<br>20.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our VAT number is [number].<br>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our details<br>21.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This website is owned and operated by [name].<br>21.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are registered in [England and Wales] under registration number [number], and our registered office is at [address].<br>21.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our principal place of business is at [address].<br>21.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can contact us by writing to the business address given above, by using our website contact form, by email to [email address] or by telephone on [telephone number].<br>Drafting notes for free website terms and conditions<br>Our website terms and conditions template has been designed for use on websites with basic interactive features, such as blogs, bulletin boards and forum-based sites.&nbsp; It includes, amongst other things, a licence specifying how the website may be used, a disclaimer of liability, a statutory disclosures section and rules on user-contributed content. It is an extended version of our website disclaimer document.<br>Free website terms and conditions body<br>Section 1 - Introduction<br>Section 1.2<br>The completed document should be easily accessible on the website, with a link from every page.<br>Section 1.3<br>Under what circumstances will users be asked to give their express consent to the terms of this document?<br>Ideally, from a legal perspective, all users would be asked to expressly agree to the terms of the document. However, in practice, express consent is rarely sought from casual website visitors. On the other hand, it is easy to obtain the express consent of users who register with the website or submit any material to the website, e.g. by clicking "I accept" on an electronic version of the document. You should retain evidence of the acceptance of the document terms by each such user.<br>Section 1.4<br>Are there any age restrictions on the use of the website?<br>What is the minimum age for website users?<br>The use of websites by minors can be legally problematic. There are a number of different legal issues. For example, under English law, contracts may be unenforceable against minors. Another issue concerns data protection. The law of data protection imposes additional burdens in relation to the processing of any personal data of a minor and personal data provided by a minor. The effects of the law of indecency may also depend upon whether a website is accessible by minors. Obviously, the inclusion of a requirement in your terms and conditions that minors refrain from using a website is no guarantee that they will do so. Where your website is directed at, or likely to be used by, minors, we recommend that you seek specialist legal advice.<br>Section 1.5<br>Does the website use cookies (including session cookies and third party cookies)?<br>What is the title of the document on the website that contains cookie information?<br>The inclusion of this statement in your website legal documents will not in itself satisfy the requirements of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (as amended) concerning consent to the use of cookies.

In many circumstances, however, the courts will find these types of limitations and exclusions to be unenforceable.<br>Somewhat different rules apply to limitations of liability in contracts with consumers, and these provisions should not be used in relation to such contracts.<br>These guidance notes provide a very incomplete and basic overview of a complex subject. Accordingly, you should take legal advice if you may wish to rely upon a limitation or exclusion of liability.<br>Section 12.1<br>Do not delete this provision (except upon legal advice). Without this provision, the specific limitations and exclusions of liability in the document are more likely to be unenforceable.<br>Section 12.3<br>Do you want to attempt to exclude all liability for free services and information?<br>This sort of exclusion is quite common, but unlikely to be enforceable in court.<br>Section 12.7<br>"Consequential loss" has a special meaning in English law: it means any loss that, whilst not arising naturally from the breach, was specifically in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made.<br>Section 12.8<br>If the website operator is a limited liability entity (e.g. a limited company), do you want to expressly exclude liability on the part of officers and employees? <br>Section 14 - Variation<br>Changes to legal documents published on a website will not generally be retrospectively effective, and variations without notice to and/or consent from relevant users may be ineffective.<br>Section 14.2<br>Will website users be notified of changes to the document?<br>Section 14.3<br>Will registered users be required to consent to variations?<br>Section 17 - Third party rights<br>This provision is designed to exclude any rights a third party may have under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.<br>Section 18 - Entire agreement<br>Section 18.1<br>What other documents govern the use of the website?<br>Section 19 - Law and jurisdiction<br>The questions of which law governs a document and where disputes relating to the document may be litigated are two distinct questions.<br>Section 19.1<br>Which law should govern the document?<br>This document has been drafted to comply with English law, and the governing law provision should not be changed without obtaining expert advice from a lawyer qualified in the appropriate jurisdiction. In some circumstances the courts will apply provisions of their local law, such as local competition law or consumer protection law, irrespective of a choice of law clause.<br>Section 19.2<br>Should the jurisdiction granted be exclusive or non-exclusive? Choose "non-exclusive" jurisdiction if you may want to enforce the terms and conditions against users outside England and Wales. Otherwise, choose "exclusive jurisdiction". The courts of which country or jurisdiction should adjudicate disputes under the document?<br>In some circumstances your jurisdiction clause may be overridden by the courts.<br>Section 20 - Statutory and regulatory disclosures<br>Do the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 apply to the website or is the website operator registered for VAT?<br>This section can be deleted where website operator is not registered for VAT and the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 do not apply. Generally, those Regulations will apply unless a website is entirely non-commercial, i.e. where a website does not offer any goods or services and does not involve any remuneration (which includes remuneration for carrying AdSense or other advertising).<br>Section 20.1<br>Is the website operator registered in a trade or similar register that is available to the public?<br>What is the name of the trade register? At what URL can the trade register be found? What is the website operator's registration number?<br>The Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 provide that if you are "registered in a trade or similar register available to the public", you must provide "details of the register in which the service provider is entered and his registration number, or equivalent means of identification in that register".<br>Section 20.2<br>Is the website operator subject to an authorisation scheme (e.g. under financial services legislation)?<br>What is the name of the authorisation scheme to which the website operator is subject? What authority supervises the authorisation scheme?<br>The Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 provide that "where the provision of the service is subject to an authorisation scheme" you must provide "the particulars of the relevant supervisory authority".<br>Section 20.3<br>Is the service provider a member of a regulated profession (e.g. solicitors)?<br>What is the website operator's professional title? Which professional body regulates the website operator? In which jurisdiction was the professional title granted? What is the name of the document containing the rules governing the profession? At what URL can the rules be found?<br>The Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 provide that if "the service provider exercises a regulated profession", it must provide "(i) the details of any professional body or similar institution with which the service provider is registered; (ii) his professional title and the member State where that title has been granted; (iii) a reference to the professional rules applicable to the service provider in the member State of establishment and the means to access them".<br>Section 20.4<br>Does the website operator subscribe to any codes of conduct?<br>Identify the codes of conduct in question. Where can the codes be viewed?<br>The Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 provide that "a service provider shall indicate which relevant codes of conduct he subscribes to and give information on how those codes can be consulted electronically".<br>Section 20.5<br>Is the website operator registered for VAT?<br>What is the website operator's VAT number?<br>Section 21 - Our details<br>UK companies must provide their corporate names, their registration numbers, their place of registration and their registered office address on their websites (although not necessarily in this document).<br>Sole traders and partnerships that carry on a business in the UK under a "business name" (i.e. a name which is not the name of the trader/names of the partners or certain other specified classes of name) must also make certain website disclosures: (i) in the case of a sole trader, the individual's name; (ii) in the case of a partnership, the name of each member of the partnership; and (iii) in either case, in relation to each person named, an address in the UK at which service of any document relating in any way to the business will be effective. All websites covered by the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 must provide a geographic address (not a PO Box number) and an email address. All website operators covered by the Provision of Services Regulations 2009 must also provide a telephone number.<br>Section 21.1<br>Mark Allen Coaching</p><p><br></p><p>Section 21.2<br>Is the website operator a company? <br></p><p>Yes.<br>In what jurisdiction is the website operator registered? <br></p><p>California<br></p><p>What is the website operator's company registration number or equivalent? What is the website operator's registered address?<br>Section 21.3<br>Optional element.<br>Where is the website operator's head office or principal place of business?<br>Section 21.4<br>What is the website operator's contact email address?
